    <h1>Grilled Corn with Cilantro Lime Butter</h1>
    <img src="../images/grilled_corn.jpg" alt="Grilled Corn">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>How good does this cilantro lime butter sound?</p>
    <p>Because it’s pretty bomb. So bomb, you’ll want to make it all the time to slather on basically everything – pasta, steak, salmon, rice. EVERYTHING.</p>
    <p>But my favorite all-star combo is on grilled corn. That perfectly charred, natural sweetness of the corn combined with the cilantro lime-y butter, melting oh-so-perfectly while the corn is still hot.</p>
    <p>Oyyyyyyy. It’s too good. And there can never be “enough” butter on your corn, right?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lime zest</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>8 ears corn, unhusked</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>1 lime, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine butter, cilantro, garlic, lime zest, chili powder and paprika; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat grill to medium heat. Peel back outer husks, leaving them attached at the base of the ear; do not remove inner husks. Remove and discard silks; rinse corn and pat dry using paper towels.</li>
        <li>Brush corn with canola oil; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add corn to grill; cover and cook, turning occasionally, until husks are slightly charred and corn is tender, about 12-15 minutes.*</li>
        <li>Peel down husks and spread with butter mixture.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with lime wedges.</li>
    </ol>
